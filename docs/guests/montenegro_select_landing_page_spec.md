# Montenegro Select — Landing Page Specification

## Brand Positioning
Montenegro Select is not a booking platform.
It is a curated access network.

Emotional goals:
- Premium
- Exclusive
- Refined
- Authoritative
- Aspirational

The landing page should feel like a private membership club, not a holiday booking site.

# 6. COLOUR STRATEGY

Primary Colours:
- Gold: #c2a24d
- Cream text: #e8e6e1
- Navy background: #0f2a44

Usage Rules:
- 90% navy background
- Main text: #e8e6e1
- Muted text: cream with reduced opacity
- Gold used sparingly for:
  - Logo
  - Buttons
  - Dividers
  - Accent lines
  - Hover effects

Gold should feel rare and intentional.

# 7. TYPOGRAPHY DIRECTION

Option 1 (Modern Premium):
- Headline: Elegant serif (e.g., Playfair-style)
- Body: Clean sans serif (e.g., Inter-style)

Option 2 (Contemporary Elite):
- Modern sans serif throughout
- Increased letter spacing on headlines

Avoid:
- Script fonts
- Ornate decorative fonts

---

# 8. INTERACTION DETAILS

To elevate perception:

- Smooth scroll transitions
- Subtle parallax on grid images
- Gold underline animation on links
- Section fade-ins
- Custom gold hover cursor for image areas

Small details reinforce premium perception.

---

# 9. WHAT NOT TO DO

Do NOT:
- Use large cliché Montenegro drone hero image
- Overload with explanatory copy
- Use discount messaging
- Use "Best prices guaranteed" language
- Create booking platform vibe

This is not a marketplace.
This is a curated network.

---

# 10. POSITIONING STRATEGY

Strong recommendation:
Position this as curated access, not open sign-up.

Psychological framing:

Instead of:
> Join Now

Use:
> Request Early Access

or
> Apply for Membership

This increases perceived value and exclusivity.

---

# Core Strategic Principle

Montenegro Select should feel like:
- A private members club
- A refined insider network
- A trusted curator of Montenegro’s best experiences

Not:
- A tourism portal
- A discount site
- A booking engine

Design everything around this distinction.
